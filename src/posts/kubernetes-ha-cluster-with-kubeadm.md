Hello everybody, Tanuj here! This post is going to guide you into setting up a Multi-Master HA (High-Availability) Kubernetes Cluster on bare-metal or virtual machines.

All our VM images will be based on Ubuntu 20.04.1 Server and for the purpose of this guide, will be Virtual Machines on a VMware ESXi host.

We will require 7 Virtual Machines with a minimum spec of 2 Cores and 4GB RAM per Node for decent performance. Also make sure that you have Static IPs assigned on your DHCP Server.

We are using the following Hostnames & IP Assignments:

* 1 HAProxy Load Balancer Node  
  — k8s-haproxy : `10.0.0.10`
* 3 Etcd/Kubernetes Master Nodes  
  — k8s-master-a : `10.0.0.11`  
  — k8s-master-b : `10.0.0.12`  
  — k8s-master-c : `10.0.0.13`
* 3 Kubernetes Worker Nodes  
  — k8s-node-a : `10.0.0.21`  
  — k8s-node-b : `10.0.0.22`  
  — k8s-node-c : `10.0.0.23`

We will also require 1 linux client machine, if unavailable, the client tools may be installed on the HAProxy node.

The minimum for production use is 2 physical hosts with at least 1 Master on each with the recommended being 3 hosts with 1 Master and 1 Worker Node Each with an external load balancer. For the sake of this guide, I am running all 7 nodes on the same ESXi host. A single host should be safe enough to use for lab and test environments but do not run anything mission critical on it.

Let's get started!

## Prepare Virtual Machines / Servers

Start by preparing 7 machines with Ubuntu 20.04.1 Server using the correct hostnames and IP addresses. Once done, power on all of them and apply the latest updates using:

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

## Setting up Client Tools

### Installing `cfssl`

CFSSL is an SSL tool by Cloudflare which lets us create our Certs and CAs.

#### Step 1 - Download the binaries

```shell
wget https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssl_linux-amd64
wget https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssljson_linux-amd64
```

#### Step 2 - Add the execution permission to the binaries

```shell
chmod +x cfssl*
```

#### Step 3 - Move the binaries to `/usr/local/bin`

```shell
sudo mv cfssl_linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cfssl
sudo mv cfssljson_linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cfssljson
```

#### Step 4 - Verify the installation

```shell
cfssl version
```

### Installing kubectl

#### Step 1 - Get the binary

make sure it's the same version as the cluster, in our case we are using v1.19

```shell
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.19.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
```

#### Step 2 - Add the execution permission to the binary

```shell
chmod +x kubectl
```

#### Step 3 - Move the binary to `/usr/local/bin`

```shell
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin
```

#### Step 4 - Verify the installation

```shell
kubectl version
```

## Installing HAProxy Load Balancer

As we will be deploying three Kubernetes master nodes, we need to deploy an HAProxy Load Balancer in front of them to distribute the traffic.

### Step 1 - SSH to the HAProxy VM

```shell
ssh username@10.0.0.10
```

### Step 2 - Install HAProxy

```shell
sudo apt-get install haproxy
```

### Step 3 - Configure HAProxy

```shell
sudo nano /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
```

Enter the following config:

```haproxy
global
...
default
...
frontend kubernetes
bind 10.0.0.10:6443
option tcplog
mode tcp
default_backend kubernetes-master-nodes

backend kubernetes-master-nodes
mode tcp
balance roundrobin
option tcp-check
server k8s-master-a 10.0.0.11:6443 check fall 3 rise 2
server k8s-master-b 10.0.0.12:6443 check fall 3 rise 2
server k8s-master-c 10.0.0.13:6443 check fall 3 rise 2
```

### Step 4 - Restart HAProxy

```shell
sudo systemctl restart haproxy
```

## Generating the TLS certificates

These steps can be done on your Linux client if you have one or on the HAProxy machine depending on where you installed the cfssl tool.

### Creating a Certificate Authority

#### Step 1 - Create the certificate authority configuration file

```shell
nano ca-config.json
```

Enter the following config:

```json
{
  "signing": {
    "default": {
      "expiry": "8760h"
    },
    "profiles": {
      "kubernetes": {
        "usages": ["signing", "key encipherment", "server auth", "client auth"],
        "expiry": "8760h"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 2 - Create the certificate authority signing request configuration file

```shell
nano ca-csr.json
```

Enter the following config, Change the names as necessary:

```json
{
  "CN": "Kubernetes",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
  {
    "C": "US",
    "L": "City",
    "O": "Organization",
    "OU": "CA",
    "ST": "State"
  }
 ]
}
```

#### Step 3 - Generate the certificate authority certificate and private key

```shell
cfssl gencert -initca ca-csr.json | cfssljson -bare ca
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! Your Bare-metal HA Cluster is ready for use. I recommend setting up Rancher Server for managing it and to setup Traefik as Ingress Controller, Longhorn as a Persistent Volume Provider, Prometheus & Grafana for Metrics and EFK Stack for Logging and Distributed Tracing. Guides for the same are in the works and will be posted in the coming weeks.

This is a test post to verify that KaTeX math rendering is working correctly. Below are some examples of mathematical expressions:

## Inline Math

Einstein's famous equation: $E = mc^2$ shows the relationship between mass and energy.

The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.

## Block Math

The Euler's identity is one of the most beautiful equations in mathematics:

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

Here's the definition of the derivative:

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

And a more complex example with aligned equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} &= -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} &= \mu_0\left(\mathbf{J} + \epsilon_0\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
